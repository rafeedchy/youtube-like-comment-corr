# youtube-like-comment-corr

In this project I used a dataset from kaggle to correlate views with like dislike of a video. Here I found that initially for a small targeted audience even small view can get large amount of like, for more views general users view this video but do not bother to like. So I took the ratio of like/view and saw that ratio declines for large amount of view. For dislikes, small amount of view has the most amount of dislikes and when view gets larger the amount of dislikes tends to be lower.
